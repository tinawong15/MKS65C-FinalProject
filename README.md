# MKS65C-FinalProject

## Checkers
Tina Wong, Maggie Zhao

## Description
The project is a multi-player checkers game. Along with the basic checkers game functionalities, such as allowing players to move across the board, the project will include a server-client connection.

For our minimum viable product, multiple users will be allowed to join the server. Once everyone has joined, the game will begin; the server splits up the users into two even(ish) teamsâ€”one team for the red checkers, and one for the white.

## Instructions to Run
1. Go to repo.
```
cd MKS65C-FinalProject/sockets_code
```
2. Compile code.
```
$ make
```
3. Run server.
```
$ ./server
```
4. Run client.
```
$ ./client
```
